# Getting Started with the Azure Data Lake Hands-on-Labs

## Documents

All the Hands-on-Lab documents, including this one, are located at http://aka.ms/AzureDataLakeHandsOnLabs

## How the Labs Work

All the Hands-on-Labs require you to have Azure services. Some labs require a single services and some labs require three or four. 

To simplify this process for you and ensured that it won't cost you any money.

# Getting your Azure services for the hands on lab 

Go to this web site: URL WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK

You will be given a set of azure services that you can use for 48 hours.

Once your 48 hours are done, you will not be able to use those services.

You can always go back to that website, and ask for the services again for another 48 hour period

# What Services will be reserved for me?

- An Azure Data Lake Store
- An Azure Data Lake Analytics Service
- An Azure Data Lake Storage account (shared among all the users)
- An Azure Data Factory Account

# What username and password do I use?

The web site will tell you how to authenticate.

If you are a Microsoft employee, you will use your Microsoft credentials.

If you are not a Microsoft employee, a temporary username and password will be assigned to you. That username and password will only work for 48 hours.
