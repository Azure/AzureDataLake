# First Steps: Azure Data Lake Tools for Visual Studio

### First steps

To get started with using Visual Studio to browse you ADL account and submit U-SQL queries, you will need the following tools:

1. Visual Studio IDE: You can use your existing Visual Studio 2012, 2013, or 2015 software. Currently Enterprise, Professional and Community editions are supported. Express is not supported. (Visual Studio "15" is not supported currently and we are working on that). If you do not have VS, go to the [Visual Studio Website](https://www.visualstudio.com/) to download the software. You can use the free Community Edition if you do not have an enterprise or MSDN license.

1. Get the latest [Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads)

1. Get The [ADL Tools for Visual Studio plug-in](https://aka.ms/ADLToolsVS)
