# Analyzing Twitter Streams in Real Time

## Storm Sample Project

The files in this directory contain a Visual Studio project definition that can be opened in VS 2013 or 2015 with the HDInsight extension installed. The individual U-SQL and C# files under this directory can also be used independently of VS if desired.

Before using this project look for areas in the code files marked with "TODO". These are places where you have to enter connections strings and configuration specific to your Azure subscriptions and setup. 

The HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio package can be installed with the latest [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). 

The free [Community Edition of VS](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) can be used with all Azure Data Lake and HDInsight plug-ins.
